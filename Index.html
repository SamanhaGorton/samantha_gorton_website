    <h1 class="center">Hello Everyone, Welcome to my Blog</h1>
    <h2 class="center">You, yes you, might ask, who is Samantha Gorton?</h2>
    <h3 class="center">Samantha and her loudness</h3>
    <p class="center">Samantha Gorton, Sam, a <em>VERY </em>loud person who is impossible to get to shut up
        . If I were told to stop laughing I would stop, sit still for a moment, and burst
        out into an even louder more obnoxious laugh than before. See I like to live in
        the moment and if I am told stop living in the moment, I will not like it and
        continue to laugh in your face.<br />
        <br>I like being the loudness, I like everyone hearing everything I have to
        say, and I like being the leader. I will voice my opinions and share the
        ways I think things should be done. Call me controlling, I dare you, because
        I will argue you on it.</br>
        <br>Arguing. a <em> key </em> part of my personality. I love arguing people,
        I mean why wouldn't I? You can be loud with people and agree with them and
        then, just prove them wrong, and being right is an amazing feeling. </p>
    <h3 class="center">Samantha and some interesting facts about her</h3>

        <br>This one time Samantha was bored so she ate half a cantaloupe at 3:30 am,
        then proceeded to make a tinfoil tellitubby hat. The next night she became
        bored again so she ate a raw onion like an apple.</br>
