    <ul>
        <li>I play varsity water polo at San Rafael High and I am the goalie, basically meaning i block really fast shots with my face.</li>
        <li>I am on the San Rafael High mountion biking team. I am not a very good mountion biker but I enjoy going to races and other team activitys</li>
        <li>I enjoy doing math when I understand it. I hate learning new things in the class because it is confusing, but once I get it I enjoy solving it.</li>
        <li>I like to bake food and use to have a job at a bakery but quit once summer ended. At the bakery I help cook foods I couldn't eat because I am gluten-free.</li>
        <li>I like scrolling through things on my phone. It gives me access to many new things and people that I wouldn't know if it weren't for my phone.</li>
