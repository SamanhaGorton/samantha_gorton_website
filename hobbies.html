    <ul class="center">
        <li>I play varsity water polo at San Rafael High and I am the goalie,
            basically meaning I block really fast shots with my face.</li>
        <li>I am on the San Rafael High mountion biking team. I am not a very
            good mountion biker but I enjoy going to races and other team activitys</li>
        <li>I enjoy doing maths when I understand it. I hate learning new
            things in the class because it is confusing, but once I get it I
            enjoy solving it.</li>
        <li>I like to bake food and use to have a job at a bakery but quit
            once summer ended. At the bakery I help cook foods I couldn't eat
            because I am gluten-free.</li>
        <li>I like scrolling through things on my phone. It gives me access
            to many new things and people that I wouldn't know if it weren't for
            my phone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="center"> With all of the practices that come with water polo I do not have much
        time for other activities such as knitting or hanging out with friends because
        it is six days a week. Once school work is added onto my plate all of Sunday
        is homework and sleeping, after practice is homework and sleeping and in
        between games at tournaments is homework and sleeping. My life is very much
        sleep, eat, school, water polo, homework, repeat.</p>
